# HR Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **employee attrition trends** and providing actionable insights to help organizations improve **employee retention**. Using **Power BI** as the primary visualization tool and a dataset of 1,470 employees, the dashboard highlights key factors influencing attrition such as age group, salary slab, job role, education, gender, and tenure.

The analysis revealed that **attrition is highly concentrated** among employees aged **26–35**, in **lower salary bands** ($\le 5\text{k}$), and in critical operational roles such as **Laboratory Technicians**, **Sales Executives**, and **Research Scientists**.

This project demonstrates strong skills in data analytics, storytelling through dashboards, and HR domain understanding—making it ideal for portfolio showcase and resume enhancement.
